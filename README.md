### Javascript Botnet Research System


The main purpose of this project is the research on the risks and possible exploits to create simple, efficient and stealthy botnets, exploring the "daily used techs" and the way the Web is being implemented, such as websites, browsers, javascripts and all that which makes your “web surfing” experiences possible, practical, "eyecandy" and addicting.


**Concept Objectives:**

Research on existent and daily used and widely available tech, for creating viable and usable botnet networks, along with the insight for possible countermeasures or mitigation techniques.


**Concept Rules:**

	* No badass 0days, malware, rootkits, whatever..., in the any stage.
	* No badass infrastructures on propagation and injection stages.
	* KISS and have fun!
